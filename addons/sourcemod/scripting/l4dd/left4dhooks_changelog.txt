	- Added Target Filters (thanks to "hoanganh810972" for reporting as missing):
		Survivors: "@s", "@surv", "@survivors"
		Specials:  "@i", "@infe", "@infected"
		Tanks:     "@t", "@tank", "@tanks"

	- Fixed native "L4D_CreateRescuableSurvivors" from not working. Now spawns all dead survivors into rescuable rooms.
	- Removed "L4D_OnGetRandomPZSpawnPosition" forward due to spawning specials at 0,0,0 when modifying any value.

1.4 (28-Feb-2020)
	- AnimHooks no longer affect the same client index if the previous user disconnected and someone else connected.
	- Clarified AnimHooks details in the include file. All AnimHooks are removed on map change.
	- Fixed L4D1: "Invalid Handle" errors caused by Director Variables fix. Thanks to "TiTz" for reporting.

1.3 (27-Feb-2020)
	- Added forward "L4D_OnGetRandomPZSpawnPosition" to display when the game selects a position.
	- Added native "L4D_GetRandomPZSpawnPosition" to select a random position.
	- Thanks to "Accelerator74" for requesting.

	- Added forward "L4D2_OnSelectTankAttackPre" to handle "ACT_*" activity numbers.
	- Changed "L4D2_OnSelectTankAttack" to use "m_nSequence" numbers instead, just like the extension did.
	- Changed the "AnimHook" functions to use "ACT_*" activity numbers (pre-hook) and "m_nSequence" animation number (post-hook).
	- Existing plugins using "L4D2_OnSelectTankAttack" no longer need to change anything.
	- Existing plugins with the new "AnimHook" hook can now use normal model "m_nSequence" sequence numbers in the post hook.
	- Thanks to "Accelerator74" for reporting the fix.

1.2 (27-Feb-2020)
	- Wildcarded the following signatures to be compatible with 3rd party plugin detours:
