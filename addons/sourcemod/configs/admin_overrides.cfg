Overrides
{
	/**
	 * By default, commands are registered with three pieces of information:
	 * 1)Command Name 		(for example, "csdm_enable")
	 * 2)Command Group Name	(for example, "CSDM")
	 * 3)Command Level		(for example, "changemap")
	 *
	 * You can override the default flags assigned to individual commands or command groups in this way.
	 * To override a group, use the "@" character before the name.  Example:
	 * Examples:
	 *		"@CSDM"			"b"				// Override the CSDM group to 'b' flag
	 * 		"csdm_enable"	"bgi"			// Override the csdm_enable command to 'bgi' flags
	 *
	 * Note that for overrides, order is important.  In the above example, csdm_enable overwrites
	 * any setting that csdm_enable previously had.
	 *
	 * You can make a command completely public by using an empty flag string.
