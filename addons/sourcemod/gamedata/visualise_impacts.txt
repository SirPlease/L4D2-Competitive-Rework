			 * To locate the `CBaseEntity::RemoveAllDecals` function, follow these steps:
			 *  1. Find the `CC_Ent_Create` function â€” it can be identified by the string "Cannot ent_create players!\n".
			 *  2. Near the end of `CC_Ent_Create`, there is a call to `UTIL_DropToFloor`. Check the xrefs to this function.
			 *  3. Among the cross-references, look for `CItem::Respawn` (usually the second-to-last one).
			 *  4. Inside `CItem::Respawn`, you will find a call to `CBaseEntity::RemoveAllDecals`.
			 *
			 * Signature:
			 *     void CBaseEntity::RemoveAllDecals( void )
